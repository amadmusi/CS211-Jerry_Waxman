 Assignment 1: Perfect Square Problem
 Find the Value
 Write a program to find and print the first perfect square (i*i) whose last two digits are both odd.
 There is no such thing as a perfect square whose last two digits are both odd. To prove this, I have
 written an explanation in the output PDF.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int
main () 
//main function
{
 int i = 1; 
//initialize and using while loop to check first condition, to start from 1
 while (true)
 
{
 
int square = i * i; 
// squaring the value
 
if (
(square > 9) && (square % 2 == 1) && (
(square / 10) % 2 == 1)
) 
// checking for last 2 digits whether odd or even
 
{
 
cout << i *
 
i << " is a perfect square whose last two digits are odd." <<
 
endl;
 
break; 
// if odd it will print the number and stop the program
 
}
 
else 
// else it will keep running until the condition is met or the given values are checked
 
{
 
i++;
 
}
 
if (i == 50)
 
{
 
cout << 
// it will run this if no solution, which is right in our case.
 
"There is no such thing as a perfect square whose last two digits are odd."
 
<< endl;
 
break;
 
}
 
}
 return 0;
}
